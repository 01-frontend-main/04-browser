## Total Blocking Time (TBT)

- Measures the `total amount of time` between `First Contentful Paint (FCP)` and `Time to Interactive (TTI)` when the main `thread is blocked` and `unable to respond` to user input

- It quantifies periods when the `page is unresponsive`, often due to `long-running JavaScript tasks` that prevent the browser from processing user interactions
