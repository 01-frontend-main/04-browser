## 2. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

- Measures the time it takes for the `largest visible content element` (such as a large image, video, or block of text) to `fully load and render on the screen` after a user navigates to a page
- LCP helps assess `how quickly the main content` of the page becomes `visible and interactive`
- A fast LCP (under `2.5 seconds`) improves user experience
